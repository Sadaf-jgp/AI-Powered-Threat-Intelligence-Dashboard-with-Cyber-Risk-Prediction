# AI-Powered-Threat-Intelligence-Dashboard-with-Cyber-Risk-Prediction
A prototype Threat Intelligence Dashboard for proactive cybersecurity defense. It aggregates threat data, applies NLP to analyze unstructured text (blogs, alerts, reports), and leverages predictive analytics to forecast risks. Insights are visualized via an interactive dashboard for real-time threat monitoring.
This project is a prototype Threat Intelligence Dashboard designed to support proactive cybersecurity defense. It collects data from multiple threat intelligence sources, applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze unstructured text such as blogs, alerts, and incident reports, and uses predictive analytics to forecast emerging threats. The insights are presented through an interactive dashboard that allows security teams to visualize, filter, and track threat trends in real time.

🚀 Features
